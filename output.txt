!dataset_title = Alzheimer's disease: neurofibrillary tangles
!dataset_description = Analysis of entorhinal cortex neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) from 10 mid-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Comparison with histopathologically normal neurons from the same patients and brain region. Results provide insight into the formation of NFTs in AD.

!dataset_title = Postmortem temporal cortex from Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC-CFAS) cohort: astrocytes
!dataset_description = Analysis of GFAP+ astrocytes representing different Braak stages and ApoE genotypes, in post-mortem temporal cortex samples. Astrocytes synthesize ApoE, which is involved in the astrocytic clearance of aggregated β-amyloid plaques. Results provide insight into role of ApoE in Alzheimer's pathology.
