!Series_title = Human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a sporadic Alzheimer's disease patient
!Series_last_update_date = Dec 31 2015
!Series_summary = Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) disease models have been generated for a number of diseases, and some have shown their potential utilization for pathological and drug toxicological evaluations. We have generated two hiPSC clones from a non-familial Alzheimer’s patient (AD-iPSCs), which expressed typical undifferentiated markers and fulfilled standard pluripotency assays. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that AD-iPSCs are highly similar to control hiPSCs and hESCs, albeit with some noticeable differences in several genes: DNAJC15, GRPR, NAIP and SNORD116-18. Several other biomarkers were differentially expressed in AD-iPSC clones, which were implicated in memory impairment and AD. Furthermore, well characterized familial AD-associated genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) and non-familial (A2M, APOE, GAP43, MAOA, MPO, PLAT, PLAU, SORL1, SNCA) exhibited different expression patterns but were largely reset upon reprogramming into a pluripotent state. Overall, hiPSCs can be good candidates for AD modeling and may represent an in vitro alternative to studying disease mechanisms and drug discovery/toxicology studies.

!Series_last_update_date = Jul 30 2015
!Series_pubmed_id = 26253202
!Series_summary = Neuronal conversion from human fibroblasts can be induced by lineage-specific transcription factors, holding great promise for human neurological disease modeling and regenerative medicine. However, the introduction of ectopic genes limits their therapeutic applications. Here, we report that neuronal cells could be directly induced from human fibroblasts by a chemical cocktail of seven small molecules bypassing neural progenitor stage. These chemical-induced neuronal cells (hciN cells) resembled hES-derived neurons regarding morphology, gene expression profiles, and electrophysiological properties. Our further experiments show that hciN cells were able to develop into mature neurons in vivo in embryonic mouse brain. Moreover, this approach was further applied to induce hciN cells from fibroblasts of familial Alzheimer’s disease patients and the hciN cells showed abnormal Aβ production. Together, we established a transgene-free chemical approach to directly induce neuronal cells from human fibroblasts, thus providing alternative strategies for modeling of related neurological diseases and regenerative medicine.
!Series_summary = We used microarray to comparethe global gene expression patterns of hES-derived neurons (control neurons), HAFs, pre-hciN cells (VCRFSGY-treated HAFs at day 3 and 7) and hciN cells (induced with VCRFSGY for 14 days)
